GeoAttend is a web-based attendance management system developed for educational institutions to simplify and digitize attendance-related workflows. 
The system is designed with a clear role-based structure, providing separate access and functionality for students, faculty members, and administrators. 
The project focuses on clean navigation, structured access control, and a modern user interface.
The application implements a role-based authentication mechanism where users select their role (Student, Faculty, or Admin) at login. 
Based on the selected role and valid credentials, users are redirected to their respective dashboards. 
This ensures that each user can only access features relevant to their role, improving both usability and security.
